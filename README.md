# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a portfolio made to showcase all of my current knowledge in the world of CSS and JS frameworks, also using TypeScript. 
It was made as part of the CS50x 2024 course, and as such, I also took the opportunity to pursue a lot of knowledge and improve in some areas I felt I was lacking in, while also experimenting with new ideas and technologies. These include:

- CSS animations and transitions.
- CSS @scope rule and component encapsulation.
- TanStack Router and component routing in general using another framework.
- React folder organization and file-based routing using TanStack Router and its file-based routing approach.
